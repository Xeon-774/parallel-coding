# Parallel AI Coding Tool - Development Roadmap

**Project**: AI-driven parallel development orchestration system
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24
**Current Phase**: Manager AI Week 0 (Completed) → Ecosystem Dashboard or Manager AI Week 0 Remaining (Next)

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the phased development approach for the Parallel AI Coding tool, which orchestrates multiple Claude AI instances to work on coding tasks in parallel. The focus is on careful, incremental development with visual verification at each stage.

---

## Phase 1: Visualization & Monitoring Foundation

The initial phase focuses on building robust monitoring and visualization capabilities to ensure transparency and verifiability of AI instance operations.

### Phase 1.1: AI Dialogue Visualization ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-24 (previous session)

**Objectives**:
- Create web-based interface for monitoring worker-orchestrator dialogues
- Implement real-time WebSocket communication
- Provide visual confirmation of AI decision-making processes

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ DialogueView component with message threading
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint for dialogue streaming
- ✅ Worker selection interface
- ✅ Real-time message updates with auto-scroll
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ Responsive two-column layout (selector + dialogue)

**Documentation**: `PHASE1_PREPARATION_COMPLETE.md`

---

### Phase 1.2: Terminal Grid Layout UI ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-24 (current session)

**Background**:
User noticed that orchestrator output only showed "APPROVED" messages, making it difficult to visually verify whether Claude AI instances were actually running. This phase was created in response to user feedback requesting side-by-side terminal comparison.

**User Request** (original Japanese):
> "webインターフェース内にワーカーaiインスタンスターミナルのナマの表示内容とオーケストレーターaiインスタンスターミナルのナマの表示内容を横に並べて見比べられるような感じにしてください。"

**Translation**:
Display raw terminal output of worker AI instances and orchestrator AI instances side by side in the web interface for visual comparison.

**Objectives**:
- ✅ Implement raw terminal output display
- ✅ Create responsive grid layout for multiple terminals
- ✅ Enable visual differentiation between worker and orchestrator terminals
- ✅ Support click-to-expand functionality
- ✅ Enable drag-and-drop reordering and resizing

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `TerminalView` component with terminal-style UI
- ✅ `TerminalGridLayout` component with react-grid-layout
- ✅ `useTerminalWebSocket` hook for WebSocket management
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint: `/ws/terminal/{worker_id}?terminal_type={type}`
- ✅ File-based terminal monitoring system
- ✅ View mode toggle (Dialogue View ↔ Raw Terminal)
- ✅ Automatic grid sizing (2x2, 3x3 based on worker count)
- ✅ Expandable modal for full-screen terminal view
- ✅ Connection status and error handling
- ✅ Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff

**Technical Implementation**:
- Backend: `orchestrator/api/terminal_ws.py` - WebSocket streaming with watchdog file monitoring
- Frontend: `components/TerminalView.tsx` - Terminal-style display (black bg, green monospace text)
- Frontend: `components/TerminalGridLayout.tsx` - Responsive grid with drag-and-drop
- Frontend: `hooks/useTerminalWebSocket.ts` - WebSocket lifecycle management

**Current Limitation**:
- Uses sample data (`raw_terminal.log`, `orchestrator_terminal.log`)
- Actual process stdout/stderr capture not yet implemented
- Infrastructure is ready, but needs integration with actual AI process output

**User Acknowledgment**:
> "ナマのターミナルキャプチャ機能がロードマップに記載されているなら大丈夫です。慎重にいきましょう。"
> Translation: "If raw terminal capture is in the roadmap, it's okay. Let's be careful."

---

### Phase 1.3: Real-time Terminal Capture ✅ COMPLETED & VALIDATED

**Status**: ✅ Completed & Validated
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-24
**Validation Date**: 2025-10-24 (same session)

**Background**:
Implemented real-time terminal capture for both worker and orchestrator AI instances. Discovered that worker capture was already partially implemented, enhanced it with flush calls, and implemented orchestrator decision logging from scratch.

**Objectives** (All Achieved):
- ✅ Capture stdout/stderr from Claude AI worker processes to `raw_terminal.log`
- ✅ Log orchestrator decision-making to `orchestrator_terminal.log`
- ✅ Real-time flush for immediate WebSocket streaming
- ✅ Error handling with logger visibility
- ✅ Integration with existing Phase 1.2 UI infrastructure

**Implementation Summary**:

1. **Process Output Capture**:
   - Modify `worker_manager.py` to capture subprocess stdout/stderr
   - Use non-blocking I/O to avoid deadlocks
   - Implement line buffering for real-time streaming

2. **File Writing Strategy**:
   - Write to `workspace/{worker_id}/raw_terminal.log` (worker output)
   - Write to `workspace/{worker_id}/orchestrator_terminal.log` (orchestrator output)
   - Implement append-only writes for watchdog monitoring compatibility

3. **ANSI Code Handling**:
   - Optionally strip ANSI escape codes for web display
   - Or implement ANSI-to-HTML conversion for styled output

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement log rotation for long-running processes
   - Consider memory-mapped files for large logs
   - Add file size limits and cleanup policies

**Integration Points**:
- `orchestrator/core/worker_manager.py` - Process execution and output capture
- `orchestrator/api/terminal_ws.py` - Already ready to stream captured output
- Frontend components - Already implemented and tested with sample data

**Success Criteria**:
- User can see actual Claude AI process output in real-time
- Output appears within 1 second of process generation
- No data loss or corruption during capture
- System remains stable with multiple concurrent workers

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Implement this carefully after current phases are stable
- Start with single worker testing before scaling to multiple
- Add comprehensive error handling for I/O failures
- Monitor system resource usage during testing

## 🆕 Task File Execution Feature ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-25)
**Feature**: Direct task file execution without AI decomposition
**Implementation**: `scripts/execute_task_files.py`

### Background
During Week 1 task preparation, discovered that existing parallel AI app only supported:
- **User Request Mode**: Natural language → AI auto-decomposition → execution

However, Week 1 tasks were already perfectly decomposed into detailed markdown files (604 lines, 882 lines). This created a mismatch requiring enhancement.

### Solution Implemented
Created `execute_task_files.py` to enable:
- **Task File Mode**: Pre-defined task.md → Direct execution

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Reads detailed task markdown files
- ✅ Spawns workers with task content as prompts
- ✅ Automatic Excellence AI Standard enforcement
- ✅ Parallel execution of multiple task files
- ✅ Integration with existing monitoring dashboard

### Test Results (2025-10-25)
**Test Task**: `TEST_SIMPLE_TASK.md` (simple Python utility)
- ✅ **Duration**: 110 seconds
- ✅ **Worker Spawn**: Successful
- ✅ **Task Execution**: Complete
- ✅ **Excellence AI Standard**: 100% applied
- ✅ **Quality**: All requirements met (≤50 lines, complexity ≤10, 100% types, docstrings)

**Issues Discovered**:
1. ⚠️ File write approval required (expected, by design)
2. ⚠️ wexpect warning: `read_nonblocking() timeout` parameter (non-blocking, fix recommended)

### Usage
```bash
# Single task
python scripts/execute_task_files.py tasks/WORKER_1_MANAGER_AI_CORE.md

# Multiple tasks (parallel)
python scripts/execute_task_files.py \
    tasks/WORKER_1_MANAGER_AI_CORE.md \
    tasks/WORKER_3_HIERARCHICAL_CORE.md
```

### Impact on Week 1 Execution
- **Ready**: Week 1 parallel execution ready to start
- **Predicted Time**: ~40 hours (parallel), vs 65 hours (sequential)
- **Approval Requests**: ~11 file creation approvals expected
- **Monitoring**: Full dashboard integration available

**Documentation**:
- Script: `scripts/execute_task_files.py` (295 lines)
- Test task: `tasks/TEST_SIMPLE_TASK.md`
- Session report: `docs/conversations/SESSION_2025_10_25_TASK_FILE_EXECUTOR.md`

---

## Notes

- User emphasized importance of visual verification for AI instance activity
- Requested side-by-side terminal comparison to confirm actual execution
- Approved current approach with sample data as long as real capture is planned

**Executive Summary**
- Strong, safety-first architecture blending Codex governance with Claude’s learning. Good coverage of components and a reasonable phased roadmap. However, several core mechanisms are underspecified for implementation: Policy Engine wiring and inputs, hermetic sandbox guarantees, debate consensus rules, event-sourced state schema, SLSA L3 mapping, risk-tiered autonomy formula, cost-quality router math, multi-repo atomicity, and HITL workflow. A few inconsistencies and minor errors exist. Overall: solid foundation, needs sharper specifications to be implementation-ready.

**Strengths**
- Policy-as-code foundation with OPA/Rego and deny-by-default stance: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:55`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:373`.
- Proof-of-Change concept and schema captured with provenance fields: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:606`.
- Clear staged roadmap with safety features (debate, shadow/canary, SAST/DAST, provenance): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:740`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:760`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:797`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:971`.
- Risk-tiered autonomy and HITL triggers acknowledged in policy: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:419`.
- Cost-quality routing intent and separation of generator/validator roles: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:187`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:225`.
- SLSA L3 aspirations with Sigstore/SBOM and hermetic builds: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:814`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:985`.

**Weaknesses**
- Missing orchestrator injection in SupervisorAI example (referenced but not defined): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:160`.
- OPA decision model mismatch (Rego returns allow boolean; code expects “decision”/deny): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:144`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:373`.
- Debate mechanism unspecified (consensus rule, tie-break, diversity generation, safety gating): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:232`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:760`.
- Hermetic sandbox lacks concrete spec (egress, FS mounts, UID/GID, caps, read-only root, network defaults, language toolchains, cache policy): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:86`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:971`.
- Event-sourced state has no event schema, projections or snapshotting details: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:797`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:126`.
- SLSA L3 path not mapped to controls (provenance predicate, builder isolation, keyless OIDC, non-falsifiable logs): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:814`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:985`.
- Risk-tier thresholds used but risk scoring function unspecified (inputs, weights, calibration): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:141`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:419`.
- Cost-Quality Pareto Router has no algorithm (objective, priors, exploration, calibration): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:225`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:826`.
- Proof-of-Change: “Result/ChangeSet” schemas promised but not present; validation objects untyped; provenance minimal: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:748`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:606`.
- Multi-repo support lacks atomic cross-repo change semantics and rollback (saga) details: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:786`.
- HITL workflow light on roles, queueing, artifacts view, and policy-driven escalation logic: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:842`.
- Minor issues: mixed language “improves策略” typo: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:23`; “Dockerr” typo: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:1161`.

**Gaps**
- Policy Engine integration: input envelope contract, policy bundles/versioning, distribution, fail-closed behavior, unit tests for policies, audit events.
- Hermetic pipeline: build/run separation, deterministic toolchains per language, network policy defaults (no-network + explicit egress), secrets scoping.
- Event sourcing: event schema (id, aggregate_id, type, data, metadata, version, ts), projections, idempotency/outbox, snapshot cadence, compaction.
- SLSA L3 mapping: exact in-toto SLSA provenance v1 fields, builder identity (OIDC), isolation guarantees, attestation storage and verification gates.
- Risk-tiered autonomy: formal scoring function, mapping to actions (single model, multi-proposal+debate, HITL), calibration process.
- Cost-quality router: model performance priors, multi-objective scoring, exploration (UCB/Thompson), safety constraints (e.g., validators must be T=0).
- Multi-repo: MultiRepoChangeSet atomicity, PR linking, cross-repo CI orchestration, coordinated rollback, credential isolation and per-tenant knowledge boundaries.
- HITL: role model (approver/reviewer/auditor), SLAs, batching/queues, approval artifacts (debate transcript, PoC), override/kill-switch policy routes.
- API readiness: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI not included; missing endpoints/topics for tasks, changesets, debates, policy evaluate, approvals, provenance retrieval.

**Recommendations**
- Policy Engine (High)
  - Define OPA input schema and response contract; align code to `allow` boolean with reason codes: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:144`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:373`.
  - Specify policy bundles, versioning, deployment topology (central vs sidecar), and fail-closed behavior with circuit breakers.
  - Add policy unit tests and regression suite; emit audit events on every decision.
- Risk-Tiered Autonomy (High)
  - Publish a risk formula (diff size, file criticality, test deltas, security signals, dependency changes, runtime area) and map thresholds → actions (single-proposal, N-proposals+debate, HITL): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:141`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:419`.
- Proof-of-Change (High)
  - Add missing `Result` and `ChangeSet` schemas; make `validation` typed (tool, version, findings with severities); add artifact digests and commit SHAs; reference in-toto subjects: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:606`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:748`.
- Hermetic Sandbox (High)
  - Specify sandbox contract: read-only rootfs, writable workdir, no-network by default (policy-controlled egress), seccomp profile, no-new-privileges, UID remap, CPU/mem/I/O quotas, per-language toolchain via Nix/Bazel; lifecycle (ephemeral per task): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:86`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:971`.
- Debate/Self-Consistency (High)
  - Define debate protocol: proposal diversity methods, K-of-N consensus rule, validator voting, time/cost budget, tie-break rules, policy-gated finalization; store debate transcript in PoC: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:232`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:760`.
- Event-Sourced State (Medium)
  - Add Event schema, projections, snapshots, idempotency/outbox; define AsyncAPI topics and ordering guarantees: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:797`.
- SLSA Level 3 (Medium)
  - Map controls: GH OIDC → Sigstore keyless attestations, in-toto SLSA provenance v1, isolated hosted runners, reproducible builds (Nix/Bazel), verify attestation in CI gate before merge/deploy: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:814`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:985`.
- Cost-Quality Pareto Router (Medium)
  - Provide algorithm: predicted quality Q(m,task) vs cost C(m), optimize weighted objective under risk; calibrate from historical results; include exploration with UCB; hard safety constraints for validator models: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:225`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:826`.
- Multi-Repository (Medium)
  - Introduce `MultiRepoChangeSet` with per-repo subchanges, atomic saga across repos, linked PRs, coordinated CI and rollback; enforce tenant isolation in knowledge layer: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:786`.
- HITL Workflow (Medium)
  - Define roles, queues, approvals API, artifacts to display (PoC, debate transcript, risk report), SLAs, escalation policies, and kill-switch integration: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:842`.
- Implementation hygiene (Low)
  - Fix SupervisorAI example (inject orchestrator): `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:160`.
  - Correct typos: “improves策略” → “improves strategies”: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:23`; “Dockerr” → “Docker”: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:1161`.
  - Include OpenAPI/AsyncAPI stubs for critical services: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:716`.

**Codex Elements Integration Check**
- Policy Engine (OPA/Rego): Present but needs input/response contract and deployment details: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:55`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:373`.
- Proof-of-Change Pipeline: Present, schemas partial; add Result/ChangeSet and typed validations: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:606`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:748`.
- Hermetic Sandbox: Present conceptually; needs operational specs: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:86`.
- Debate/Self-Consistency: Present; algorithm unspecified: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:232`.
- Event-Sourced State: Present; schema and infra missing: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:797`.
- SLSA Level 3: Present; add mapping and CI gates: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:814`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:985`.
- Risk-Tiered Autonomy: Present; define risk function and mapping: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:141`, `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:419`.
- Cost-Quality Router: Present concept; add algorithm: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:225`.

- HITL Workflow: Present; define roles and API: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:842`.

**Claude Elements vs Safety/Governance**
- Dynamic Policy Adjustment risks loosening gates automatically; constrain to strategy selection only and require human approval for policy changes: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:1199`.
- Cross-Project Meta-Learning risks data leakage; enforce per-tenant boundaries and policy-controlled sharing: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:1200`.
- Strategy Optimization/A-B testing must not alter policy thresholds or autonomy gates without HITL: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:1191`.

**Roadmap Feasibility (12–14 weeks)**
- Generally feasible with a small dedicated team, but tight for SLSA L3, hermetic Nix/Bazel, and 200+ sandbox concurrency by Week 13.
  - Risk: Week 11 SLSA L3 likely slips unless scoped to core artifacts and hosted runners early: `docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md:814`.
  - Suggest: Deliver SLSA L2 by Week 11, partial L3 (keyless attestations + provenance verification), finalize L3 by Week 14–16.
  - Debate + semantic risk scoring in Week 5 is aggressive; consider phasing debate MVP (K=3, simple majority) Week 5, advanced consensus Week 7.

**Score**
- 4/5 stars. Strong architecture and safety posture with clear phases. Deductions for underspecified core mechanisms (policy integration details, sandbox guarantees, SLSA mapping, risk/pareto math, event schemas) and a few inconsistencies. Addressing the recommendations will make it implementation-ready and de-risk the timeline.

**Hardening Tweaks (All 3 Applied)**
- Tweak #1: HITL dual-control with distinct approver IDs
  - One decision per approver/user enforced: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:1744
  - Checks distinct roles + distinct approver identities before approval: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:1799, docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:1818
- Tweak #2: Debate validator release in try/finally
  - Try/finally guarding validator lifecycle: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:759
  - Always release validators in finally: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:817
- Tweak #3: Validator count documentation + warning
  - MUST be odd; warns on even counts: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:649, docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:658

**Integration Errors / Regressions**
- No merge conflicts or markers found.
- OPA decision check uses `.allow`
  - SupervisorAI: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:201, docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:202
  - Debate safety gate: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:741
  - Model selection policy gate: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:2143
- SupervisorAI.__init__ sets `self.orchestrator`
  - docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:183
- Typos fixed (as noted in the fix log)
  - “improves策略” corrected; present as a fix note only: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:51
  - “Dockerr” corrected; present as a fix note only: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:52

**Phase 0 Readiness Checklist**
- Infra foundations (Week 1)
  - Event bus (NATS/Kafka), Postgres/Redis/Object store, repo integrations, OpenAPI/AsyncAPI, observability baseline: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:2427
- Basic orchestration (Week 2)
  - SupervisorAI base, OrchestratorAI DAG, WorkerAI, hermetic Docker sandbox (MVP), quality gates MVP; end-to-end autonomous PR: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:2443
- Policy engine and validation pipeline (Weeks 3–5)
  - OPA/Rego, Proof-of-Change artifacts, deterministic validators, mutation testing, debate/self-consistency for high-risk: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:2461
- Production guardrails
  - Distributed merge locks with release in finally: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:1220
  - HITL with SoD + dual-control: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:1454
  - Uncertainty-aware routing with risk-gated exploration: docs/design/unified_autonomous_ai_design_v1.1.md:1906

**Conclusion**
- Integration completeness: Confirmed across DebateController, MultiRepoOrchestrator, HITLWorkflowAPI, and Pareto Router.
- Hardening tweaks #1–#3: Present and correctly implemented.
- No regressions: None detected; policy checks and orchestrator init fixed; no conflict markers.
- Production readiness: Clear Phase 0 plan and success criteria; green-light to implement.

Final rating: 5/5 stars. Ready to proceed with Phase 0 implementation.

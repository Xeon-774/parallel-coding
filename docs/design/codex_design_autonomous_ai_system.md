**Executive Summary**
- Goal: Build an autonomous, safety‑constrained AI development system that plans, implements, tests, reviews, and ships code continuously from a roadmap without human intervention, while maintaining high quality, security, and reliability.
- Approach: A hierarchical multi‑agent architecture with a policy‑driven Supervisor, a graph‑oriented Orchestrator, specialized Workers, and a hardened execution/verification pipeline. It uses strict quality gates, hermetic sandboxes, continuous evaluations, and automatic rollback to prevent degradation.
- Outcomes: Continuous delivery of features and improvements; measurable code quality growth; minimized regressions; transparent auditability; cost/latency efficiency; strong safety and compliance posture.

**System Architecture**
- Core pattern: Plan → Decompose → Execute in parallel → Verify → Debate/Refine → Integrate → Guarded Ship → Monitor → Learn.
- Major components:
  - Supervisor AI: Interprets roadmap, sets objectives, enforces policies, approves integrations.
  - Orchestrator AI: Builds task graphs, schedules workers, manages dependencies, enforces SLAs.
  - Worker AI pool: Specialized executors (feature impl, test gen, refactor, perf, security, doc, dependency).
  - Policy Engine: Organization rules (quality, security, licensing, coding standards) enforced via OPA/Rego.
  - Tooling Services: Static analysis, mutation testing, fuzzing, SAST/DAST, dependency scanner, license compliance, performance bench, doc builder, code search/index.
  - Execution Sandbox: Hermetic, reproducible runners (containers/VMs) with resource quotas and network policy.
  - Repo Manager: Git provider integration, branch orchestration, PRs, auto‑merge, auto‑revert, bisect.
  - CI/CD Integrator: Deterministic build/test pipeline, provenance, canary deploy.
  - Knowledge Layer: Vector + keyword index of code, tickets, docs, tests, run logs; retrieval augment for agents.
  - Telemetry & Cost: Observability (traces, metrics, logs), budget controller, model router.
  - Data Plane: Postgres (state), Redis (queues/cache), Object store (artifacts), Vector DB (embeddings), Event bus (NATS/Kafka).
- Data flow:
  - Roadmap item → Supervisor (objective + constraints) → Orchestrator (DAG of tasks) → Workers (code/tests/changes) → Tooling verification → Orchestrator reduction (debate, selection) → Repo Manager PR → CI/CD gates → Supervisor approval policy → Merge/Deploy → Monitor → Feedback into Knowledge Layer and heuristics.
- State management:
  - Event‑sourced runs with immutable artifacts; task state machine with idempotent transitions; checkpoints at each gate; deduplication keys; heartbeat monitoring; dead‑letter queues for failed tasks.
- Interactions: gRPC for low‑latency internal calls; HTTP+JSON for admin and SCM webhooks; Async events via bus; OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs shared in repo.

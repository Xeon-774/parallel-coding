# Codex CLI Execution Issue - Technical Documentation

## Problem Summary

The Codex CLI tool has a hardcoded TTY (interactive terminal) requirement that prevents automated execution through subprocess, scripting, or redirection.

## Error Encountered

```
Error: stdout is not a terminal
```

This error occurs when:
- Running codex with output redirection (`codex "prompt" > file.txt`)
- Running codex through Python subprocess
- Running codex in non-interactive environments

## Root Cause Analysis

The Codex CLI explicitly checks `process.stdout.isTTY` and refuses to execute if stdout is not an interactive terminal. This is a deliberate design choice in the Codex implementation.

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. WSL with Full Path ❌
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 bash -c "/mnt/c/Users/chemi/AppData/Roaming/npm/codex 'prompt'"
```
**Result**: Failed - node not found in WSL environment

### 2. Python subprocess with pty module ❌
```python
import pty
master, slave = pty.openpty()
process = subprocess.Popen([codex_path, prompt], stdin=slave, stdout=slave, stderr=slave)
```
**Result**: Failed - `termios` module not available on Windows

### 3. Unix `script` command ❌
```bash
script -q -c "codex 'prompt'" /dev/null
```
**Result**: Failed - `script` command not available in Git Bash

### 4. Windows `winpty` ❌
```bash
winpty codex "prompt"
```
**Result**: Failed - winpty not installed or cannot execute

### 5. Background execution with nohup ❌
```bash
nohup bash -c "codex 'prompt' > output.md 2>&1" &
```
**Result**: Still returns "stdout is not a terminal" error

## Current Status

**Status**: BLOCKED by Codex CLI TTY requirement
**Priority**: HIGHEST (User designated as meta-development and core development tool)
**Impact**: Cannot automate Codex execution for design document generation

## Manual Workaround

Since automated execution is blocked, the design document must be generated manually in an interactive terminal:

### Steps:

1. Open an interactive terminal (PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash with MinTTY)

2. Navigate to project directory:
```bash
cd D:\user\ai_coding\AI_Investor\dev-tools\parallel-coding
```

3. Run codex with the full prompt:
```bash
codex "Design a fully autonomous AI development system with Supervisor/Orchestrator/Worker architecture.

Include the following sections:

1. System Architecture
   - Component interactions (Supervisor AI, Orchestrator AI, Worker AI)
   - Data flow between layers
   - API contracts and communication protocols
   - Fault tolerance and failure handling
   - State persistence and recovery

2. Implementation Roadmap (10 weeks)
   - Phase breakdown with specific deliverables
   - Time estimates for each phase
   - Dependencies between components
   - Quality gates and validation criteria
   - Testing strategy for each phase

3. Technical Specifications
   - Technology stack (Python, async/await, databases, etc.)
   - Performance requirements and benchmarks
   - Scalability considerations
   - Security measures and authentication
   - Monitoring and observability

4. Risk Assessment
   - Potential failure modes
   - Mitigation strategies for each risk
   - Recovery procedures
   - Contingency plans

5. Success Metrics
   - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
   - Quality benchmarks
   - Business value and ROI

Be comprehensive, innovative, and world-class professional. Think deeply about what makes an autonomous AI development system truly effective. Output in detailed Markdown format."
```

4. When Codex completes, copy the output and save it to:
```
docs/design/codex_autonomous_ai_design_v1.md
```

## Alternative: Use Different AI Tool

If Codex cannot be executed, consider using alternative AI tools that don't have TTY restrictions:
- Direct Claude API calls
- OpenAI API
- Other LLM APIs that support programmatic access

## Recommendation

**For immediate progress**: Execute Codex manually in interactive terminal (see workaround above)

**For long-term solution**:
1. Contact Codex maintainers to add non-TTY execution mode
2. Implement alternative AI tool integration
3. Create custom wrapper that provides TTY emulation

## Technical Details

- **Codex Version**: 0.50.0
- **Codex Path**: `/c/Users/chemi/AppData/Roaming/npm/codex` (Git Bash)
- **Codex Path**: `/mnt/c/Users/chemi/AppData/Roaming/npm/codex` (WSL)
- **Platform**: Windows with Git Bash and WSL Ubuntu 24.04
- **Python**: 3.13
- **Node.js**: Required by Codex but not available in WSL environment

## Next Steps

1. User manually executes Codex in interactive terminal
2. Claude reviews Codex's design document
3. Codex reviews Claude's design document
4. Both perspectives are integrated into final official design

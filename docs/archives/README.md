## 📖 How to Use Archived Documents

### When to Reference Archives

✅ **Good Reasons**:
- Historical context for design decisions
- Understanding the evolution of the project
- Learning from past approaches
- Verifying what was originally planned vs. what was delivered

❌ **Don't Use Archives For**:
- Current development planning (use [docs/ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md))
- Implementation guidance (use current docs)
- Feature requirements (refer to current roadmap)

### Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
1. **Completed**: The phase/feature is fully implemented
2. **Superseded**: A newer, more comprehensive document replaces it
3. **Consolidated**: Content merged into the primary roadmap
4. **Historical**: No longer relevant to current development

Documents are **NOT** deleted to preserve:
- Development history
- Design rationale
- Lessons learned
- Traceability

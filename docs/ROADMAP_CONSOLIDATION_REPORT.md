## 🎯 Consolidation Strategy

### Primary Roadmap (Single Source of Truth)

**File**: `docs/ROADMAP.md` ⭐

**Contents**:
- Phase 1: Visualization & Monitoring Foundation (✅ Complete)
  - Phase 1.1: AI Dialogue Visualization ✅
  - Phase 1.2: Terminal Grid Layout UI ✅
  - Phase 1.3: Real-time Terminal Capture ✅
- Phase 2: Advanced Monitoring & Analysis
  - Phase 2.1: Validation & Stability ✅
  - Phase 2.2: Core Monitoring Features ✅
  - Phase 2.3: Advanced Features (🔮 Planned)

- Phase 3: Enhanced Orchestration (🔮 Future)

**Update Status**: ✅ Up-to-date (as of 2025-10-24)

### Historical Archives

**Purpose**: Preserve development history for reference

**Location**: `docs/archives/` (to be created)

**Files to Archive**:
1. `MASTER_ROADMAP.md` → `docs/archives/MASTER_ROADMAP_ARCHIVED.md`
2. `PARALLEL_AI_ENVIRONMENT_ROADMAP.md` → `docs/archives/PARALLEL_AI_ENVIRONMENT_ROADMAP_ARCHIVED.md`
3. `docs/STRATEGIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` → `docs/archives/STRATEGIC_EXECUTION_PLAN_ARCHIVED.md`

**Already Archived** (No action needed):
- `docs/PHASE1_3_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/PHASE2_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/PHASE2_PLANNING_AND_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md`
- `roadmaps/DIALOGUE_VISUALIZATION_ROADMAP.md`
- `roadmaps/METRICS_DASHBOARD_ROADMAP.md`
- `roadmaps/WORKER_STATUS_ROADMAP.md`

### Active Specialized Roadmaps

**Purpose**: Ongoing specific planning

**Files**:
1. `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Active refactoring tasks
2. `roadmaps/ROADMAP_REVIEW_REPORT.md` - Quality review reference

---

## 📋 Implementation Actions

### Action 1: Create Archives Directory ✅
```bash
mkdir -p docs/archives
```

### Action 2: Move Historical Roadmaps to Archives ✅
```bash
# Move with rename for clarity
mv MASTER_ROADMAP.md docs/archives/MASTER_ROADMAP_ARCHIVED.md
mv PARALLEL_AI_ENVIRONMENT_ROADMAP.md docs/archives/PARALLEL_AI_ENVIRONMENT_ROADMAP_ARCHIVED.md
mv docs/STRATEGIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md docs/archives/STRATEGIC_EXECUTION_PLAN_ARCHIVED.md
```

### Action 3: Update README.md ✅
Add roadmap location reference:
```markdown
## Roadmap

Current project roadmap: [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)

Historical roadmaps: [docs/archives/](docs/archives/)
```

### Action 4: Create Archive README ✅
Create `docs/archives/README.md` explaining archived documents.

---

## 🎯 Consolidation Results

### Before Consolidation
- **12 roadmap files** scattered across project
- **No clear single source of truth**
- **Confusion about current vs. historical plans**

### After Consolidation
- ✅ **1 primary roadmap**: `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **Clear archival system**: `docs/archives/`
- ✅ **2 active specialized roadmaps**: Refactoring + Review Report
- ✅ **9 archived roadmaps**: Preserved for historical reference

{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_0","type":"reasoning","text":"**Creating an email validator**\n\nI'm looking to write a Python file for a function called `validate_email(email: str) -> bool`, using regex to check email validity. I'll make sure to add a docstring with examples and save it as `email_validator.py`. Following the developer instructions, I want minimal code and a robust regex pattern, ensuring it properly accounts for common email forms without needing full RFC 5322 compliance. The regex will define valid local parts and domain labels. Let’s put this together!"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_1","type":"reasoning","text":"**Defining the domain regex**\n\nI need to finalize the regex for validating the domain part of the email. The pattern will ensure at least one dot and that the top-level domain has two or more letters. I'm considering whether to allow numeric TLDs, but I think I'll stick with letters for now. Also, while subdomains are fine, I won't support domain-literal IPs or localhost addresses. \n\nI’ll include a docstring with examples and type hints, not necessarily a module docstring, but I’ll definitely use raw strings for the regex pattern. Let's implement this!"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_2","type":"reasoning","text":"**Crafting validation examples**\n\nI’ve laid out some examples to showcase how the `validate_email` function works. These illustrate various scenarios, such as valid emails and common pitfalls like consecutive dots or starting with a dot. Each example clearly indicates whether the given input should return `True` or `False`. \n\nNow, I need to define the regex patterns for the local part and the domain labels. I plan to structure the overall regex pattern using a combination of these; the final pattern will ensure that both parts are correctly formatted. Let's get this crafted!"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_3","type":"reasoning","text":"**Defining TLD rules and regex**\n\nI'm compiling the regex pattern with `re.IGNORECASE` to manage case differences. I need to think carefully about how to handle Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), specifically the punycode 'xn--'. While those do contain hyphens, our TLD rules should focus on letters only, which means we might need to exclude anything with digits or hyphens in the TLD.\n\nI believe it's simpler to stick with traditional rules—letters only for TLDs, requiring at least two characters. Including docstring disclaimers can help clarify our choices, so I'll keep that in a \"pragmatic\" style. Let’s finalize this!"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_4","type":"reasoning","text":"**Finalizing implementation details**\n\nI'm planning to include a note in the docstring stating that this function performs pragmatic syntax checks typical for web apps but doesn’t ensure deliverability or full RFC 5322 compliance. After that, I'll implement the code in `email_validator.py`. I think it'll be good to annotate `EMAIL_REGEX` as `Final`, which helps indicate that it won’t change.\n\nI'll import the necessary modules and use the `re.Pattern` from `typing`. For the docstring, I'll keep it simple in doctest style. Finally, I'll follow the developer instructions for minimal code and call the `apply_patch` tool to create the file. Let’s get started!"}}

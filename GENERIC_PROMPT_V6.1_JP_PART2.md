I tried to read the source, but `/tmp/prompt_part2.md` isn’t accessible from this workspace.

- Please either:
  - Paste lines 198–394 here, or
  - Copy the file into the workspace and give the path (e.g., `dev-tools/parallel-coding/prompt_part2.md`), or
  - Upload the whole file and I’ll extract lines 198–394.

Once I have the text, I’ll translate it per your rules and write `GENERIC_PROMPT_V6.1_JP_PART2.md`.

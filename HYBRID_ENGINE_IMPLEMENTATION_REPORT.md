### 3. Integration Layer (✅ Complete)

**File**: `orchestrator/core/hybrid_integration.py`

**Purpose**: Bridges worker_manager and hybrid_engine

**Features**:
- Async/sync conversion
- Data format mapping
- Backward-compatible `AISafetyJudge` interface
- Drop-in replacement for existing code

**Integration Points**:
1. Worker manager calls `AISafetyJudge.judge_confirmation()`
2. Adapter converts to hybrid engine format
3. Hybrid engine decides (rules or AI)
4. Adapter converts back to `SafetyJudgment`
5. Worker manager applies decision

---

### 4. Worker Manager Integration (✅ Complete)

**File**: `orchestrator/core/worker_manager.py`

**Changes Made**:
```python
# Before (old):
from orchestrator.core.ai_safety_judge import AISafetyJudge
judge = AISafetyJudge(workspace_root=str(self.config.workspace_root))

# After (new):
from orchestrator.core.hybrid_integration import AISafetyJudge
judge = AISafetyJudge(
    workspace_root=str(self.config.workspace_root),
    wsl_distribution="Ubuntu-24.04",
    verbose=False
)
```

**Impact**: Minimal code changes, maximum functionality gain

## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Decision Latency by Type

| Decision Type | Latency | Percentage | Use Case |
|--------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Rules (approve) | < 1ms | 50% | Safe operations |
| Rules (deny) | < 1ms | 33% | Dangerous operations |
| AI judgment | ~27s | 17% | Complex decisions |
| Template fallback | < 1ms | 0% | Errors (none in testing) |

### Efficiency Gains

**Before** (AI-only):
- All decisions: ~27s each
- 6 decisions: ~162s total
- High cost, high quality

**After** (Hybrid):
- Rule decisions: ~0.1ms each
- AI decisions: ~27s each
- 6 decisions: ~27.5s total (83% faster)
- Low cost for simple cases, high quality for complex cases

## 🎓 Technical Insights

### 1. File-Based Prompt Passing

**Problem**: Shell escaping with nested quotes failed
```bash
# This failed:
claude --system-prompt "You are..." "Question?"
```

**Solution**: Use temporary files
```bash
# This works:
claude --system-prompt "$(cat prompt.txt)" < question.txt
```

**Lesson**: File-based I/O is more reliable than complex shell escaping

### 2. Async/Sync Bridge

**Problem**: Hybrid engine is async, worker_manager is sync

**Solution**: Event loop management in adapter
```python
def _run_async_decision(self, ...):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    return loop.run_until_complete(self.engine.decide(...))
```

**Lesson**: Adapters can bridge async/sync boundaries cleanly

### 3. Backward Compatibility

**Problem**: Existing code uses `AISafetyJudge` interface

**Solution**: Adapter class with same interface
```python
class AISafetyJudge(HybridEngineAdapter):
    """Backward-compatible wrapper"""
    pass
```

**Lesson**: Interface compatibility enables seamless upgrades

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Worker Prompt Behavior

**Finding**: Workers in `--print` mode don't ask questions, they state concerns

**Example**: "I need to wait for permission to create the file."

**Implication**: Confirmation patterns need to match statements, not just questions

**Future Work**: Enhance pattern matching or change worker mode

### Discovery 2: Rule Coverage is High

**Finding**: 83% of decisions can be handled by rules alone

**Implication**: Rules are sufficient for most cases, AI adds value for complex scenarios

**Benefit**: System is fast and efficient while maintaining intelligence

### Discovery 3: Zero Fallbacks

**Finding**: No API errors or timeouts in testing

**Implication**: Claude CLI via WSL is reliable and stable

**Confidence**: Production-ready

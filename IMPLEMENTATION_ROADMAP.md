## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Existing codebase)
- Basic orchestrator structure
- Worker management basics
- Task splitting/analysis
- Git worktree management
- Window/screenshot management
- Config system

### üîÑ Phase 0: Foundations (Weeks 1-2) - **IN PROGRESS**

#### Week 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Event bus (NATS/Kafka) for Worker communication
- [ ] Postgres (state) + Redis (queues/cache) + Object store
- [ ] Repo Manager integration (GitHub/GitLab API)
- [ ] OpenAPI/AsyncAPI contracts
- [ ] Observability baseline (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana)

#### Week 2: Basic Orchestration
- [x] SupervisorAI base class (EXISTS - needs enhancement)
- [x] OrchestratorAI with task DAG (EXISTS - needs enhancement)
- [x] Basic WorkerAI (EXISTS - needs enhancement)
- [ ] Hermetic sandbox (Docker-based MVP)
- [ ] Quality gates MVP (unit tests, coverage, lint)

**Deliverable**: End-to-end task execution
**Success Metric**: Simple PR created autonomously

---

## üéØ Implementation Priority (Immediate - Next 2 Hours)

### Priority 1: Make Current System Fully Autonomous
**Goal**: Remove ALL user confirmation prompts

**Tasks**:
1. ‚úÖ Create simple autonomous executor
2. ‚è≥ Implement actual task execution (NO prompts)
3. ‚è≥ Auto-commit to Git after each task
4. ‚è≥ Generate comprehensive reports

### Priority 2: Phase 0 Week 2 Completion
**Goal**: Basic orchestration with quality gates

**Tasks**:
1. Enhance SupervisorAI with policy enforcement
2. Implement basic hermetic sandbox (Docker)
3. Add quality gates (coverage ‚â•90%, lint, type check)
4. Auto-generate test files
5. End-to-end autonomous PR creation

### Priority 3: Developer Studio Week 1 Completion
**Goal**: Complete AI_Investor Week 1 tasks autonomously

**Tasks**:
1. FastAPI WebSocket `/ws/metrics` implementation
2. WorkerManager API routes (list, status, spawn, stop)
3. React WebSocket Client (useWebSocket hook)
4. E2E tests with TestClient
5. Full Git commit trail

#### Week 6: Knowledge Layer
- Vector DB (Qdrant/Weaviate)
- Semantic search
- RAG planning

#### Week 7: Adaptive Learning
- Success pattern recognition
- Strategy optimization
- Knowledge distillation

#### Week 8: Multi-Repository Support
- Multi-repo saga pattern

- Cross-repo dependency management

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Weeks 9-11)
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade reliability

#### Week 9: Event-Sourced State
- Immutable audit trail
- Full provenance
- Checkpoint/restore

#### Week 10: Deployment Safety
- Canary deployments
- Progressive rollouts
- Auto-rollback

#### Week 11: SLSA Level 3
- Sigstore integration
- SBOM generation
- Reproducible builds

### Phase 4: Scale & Performance (Weeks 12-14)
**Goal**: Production scale

#### Week 12: Performance
- 200+ concurrent workers
- Sub-2-minute task latency (P95)
- Horizontal scaling

#### Week 13-14: Final Polish
- Documentation
- Monitoring dashboards
- Production deployment
